    About Me 

    Hello Everyone 
    My Name is Mukesh and this is a place for me to put a lot of my random thoughts and practice a variety of tools 
    Certain things in life, I am inexplicably drawn to. There are the set of people who nurture and develop people's curiosities and ambitions
    then there are those who seek to use you as an ends to a means. We have to protest this possibility. 

    <div>
        Everything in life is extremely difficult. Suffering cannot be escaped. We should then spend our time suffering on something that is worth it.
